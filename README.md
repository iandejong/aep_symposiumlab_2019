### Story

Luma, a health & wellbeing business, wants to stream real-time customer behavioural data to Adobe Experience Platform, upload CRM data once in Adobe's ecosystem to use it everywhere, and link all attributes and behavior to the Customer Profile in real-time. The ultimate end goal is to leverage & activate this information and these profiles in real-time as well, to any channel.
As you may know, customer retention is a key focus area for any company, and the same goes for Luma. 
Being able to easily open up access to the customer experience data inside Adobe Experience Platform is critical, as are predictive insights through Machine Learning and AI.
