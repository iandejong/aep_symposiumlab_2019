## Exercise 1 - Visit the Luma website

In this exercise, you'll follow a script and walk through the Luma website on your local machine.

The URL to access the Luma website is: [http://luma.adobe.com](http://luma.adobe.com:8080)
 
### Story
In this exercise, the goal is to have you walk through the Luma customer journey and act like a real customer.

You can access the demo website by going to [http://luma.adobe.com](http://luma.adobe.com:8080)

On this website, we've implemented Adobe Experience Platform. Every activity is considered an 'Experience Event', is sent like that to Adobe Experience Platform in real-time, and hydrates the Real-Time Customer Profile.

In this journey, you'll start as an anonymous customer who browses the Luma website and after a couple of steps, you'll become a known customer which will fuel Adobe Experience Platform's Real-Time Customer Profile.

Go back to the Homepage of the Luma website and open the Adobe Experience Platform X-ray panel. The X-ray panel is a live and dynamic panel that updates in real-time and shows the kind of information that is available in Adobe Experience Platform.

By opening the Real Time Customer Profile panel, you should see something similar to the below, showing the different identities that are part of your profile, together with the declared personal information that you filled out on the registration form.

By opening the Experience Events panel, you should be seeing an entry for each page you've visited. Please note that Adobe Experience Platform captures and stores all data by linking it to an ID, regardless of whether the customer was anonymous or known. You'll notice that all your page views are shown here, also for the pages that were visited while you were still unknown.
