## Before we start...

During the exercises, you'll have to login a number of times in Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Experience Platform Launch.

Your username is on your desktop in the upper left corner of your screen and looks like this:
**dxXX@tryadobe.com**, where 'XX' is your computer number.

Your password is also on your desktop in the upper left corner of your screen and is:
**Sydney!2019**

To avoid typo's, it's a good idea to copy your password from here and paste it when logging in.

Your Computer Number is a number between **01** and **80**, you can find it in the upper left corner of your screen.
